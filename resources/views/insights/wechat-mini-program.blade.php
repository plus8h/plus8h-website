                    We would not go as far to say the native app is dead. But with the emerge and increased popularity of mini-programs you maybe should ask when, rather than if, these applications take over as the main tool for daily life tasks and experiences. With more than 1 million mini-programs you can do almost anything, from order food or pay utility bills to buy a movie ticket or find love. The over 200 categories of mini-programs let you conduct basically any daily task you wish

                            uk-margin-medium-bottom">So what is a “mini-program”?</h2>

                <p class="uk-margin-medium-bottom">
                    In 2017 WeChat launched an App-in-App function for their ever so successful WeChat super app. Due to a dispute with Apple, the word APP couldn’t be used to mini-program became the term. Though, it is sometimes referred to as “mini-app”.
                </p>

                <p class="uk-margin-medium-bottom">
                    With a limited space of just 10mb (excluding pictures and video content) and developed with a propriety programming language (similar to HTML, Javascript and CSS), a mini-program has real fast loading speed which enables great user experience. The mini-program can be programmed to do basically anything a native app can do. With even more API’s allowed from Tencent, mini-programs can now function eCommerce platforms for both domestic and cross border eCommerce, task management, live-streaming, live information platform or online courses.
                </p>

                <h2 class="is-size-3
                            has-text-white
                            uk-margin-medium-bottom">Why a mini-program?</h2>

                <p class="uk-margin-medium-bottom">
                    The biggest advantage a mini-program has over a native app is that the user does not need to download nor install anything on her device. As it operate within WeChat there is no registration needed either.
                </p>

                <p class="uk-margin-medium-bottom">
                    The mini-program is all online based and withing the WeChat ecosystem. You simply open the mini-program when needed, use all the functions it offers and when you are done you close the tab.
                </p>

                <p class="uk-margin-medium-bottom">
                    Another great feature is the integration with WeChat pay which enables fast and simple payments. Both for the consumer and for the brand operating the mini-program.
                </p>

                <h2 class="is-size-3
                            has-text-white
                            uk-margin-medium-bottom">Access it anywhere</h2>

                <p class="uk-margin-medium-bottom">
                    You can also access the mini-program from a lot of places. Scan a QR code which functions well for O2O, link in an official account, invitation from friends and groups, or find it via the search function. You may also save your favourite mini-programs in your WeChat to for even easier access. 
                </p>

                            uk-margin-medium-bottom">The future is now</h2>

                <p class="uk-margin-medium-bottom">
                    WeChats mini-program is not just an upcoming “new kid on the block”. Some figures show that mini-programs will surpass native apps in numbers, both on App store and google play, by end of 2021. 
                </p>

                <p class="uk-margin-medium-bottom">
                    Not only does most brands compliment their marketplace flagship store with a mini-program eCommerce store. But also the major marketplaces like JD have their own mini-programs too boost traffic and sales.
