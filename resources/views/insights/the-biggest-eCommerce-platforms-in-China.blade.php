Tmall can therefore be seen as a virtual shopping center which host most larger domestic and international brands you can think of. The main idea about Tmall is that it should be simple and only quality sellers are allowed, so buyers do not have to worry about the product they have purchased. This also mean there are higher requirements for a business to enter Tmall and longer processes to be approved to operate within this eco-system. Tmall has two different offering, the traditional domestic Tmall and the Tmall Global which is a cross border service for foreign entities that do not have a presence in China but still wishes to try out the market. For Tmall Global the requirements are still high to ensure the quality of business entering the platform. Tmall sells almost everything, from fashion to food, but is especially well-known to Chinese consumers to be the go-to place for fashion items. Therefore, 67% of the consumers on Tmall are also female.
